# AI-Powered Lottery Prediction System

## 🚀 Overview

An advanced machine learning system designed to analyze historical lottery data and generate predictions using ensemble learning techniques. This project utilizes multiple AI models including LSTM neural networks, CNN-LSTM hybrid models, and custom feature engineering to identify patterns in lottery drawings.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Multi-Model Ensemble**: Combines predictions from LSTM and CNN-LSTM models with optimized weights
- **Interactive Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bars during data download, model training, and prediction
- **Advanced Cross-Validation**: Time series validation with rolling windows for robust model evaluation
- **Enhanced Feature Engineering**: Extracts complex patterns from historical lottery data
- **Prediction Diversity**: Generates varied predictions through controlled perturbation techniques
- **Performance Monitoring**: Detects model drift and tracks prediction quality over time
- **Visualization Tools**: Creates intuitive graphics of model performance and predictions
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All operations are logged to `logs/lottery.log` for traceability

## 📋 System Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- 8GB+ RAM (16GB+ recommended)
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional, for faster training)
- 1GB+ free disk space

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd lottery-prediction-system

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Get Started

To get up and running quickly:

1. Make sure all requirements are installed
2. Run the main script to generate predictions:

```bash
# Run the prediction system with defaults (no retraining)
python scripts/main.py
```

The system will automatically:
- Load cached lottery data (or download if not available)
- Load pre-trained models (or train if not available)
- Generate and display predictions with visualizations
- Save results to the outputs directory

## 📊 Usage

The system offers several command-line options to customize its behavior:

```bash
# Generate predictions using existing models
python scripts/main.py

# Retrain models with fresh data
python scripts/main.py --retrain yes --force

# Generate a specific number of diverse predictions
python scripts/main.py --count 10 --diversity 0.5
```

### Command Line Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `--retrain {yes,no}` | Retrain models from scratch (yes) or use existing trained models (no) |
| `--force` | Force download of fresh lottery data from the web |
| `--count COUNT` | Number of predictions to generate (default: 10) |
| `--diversity DIVERSITY` | Diversity level for predictions (0-1, default: 0.5) |
| `--sequence-length LENGTH` | Sequence length for model training (default: 30) |
| `--seed SEED` | Random seed for reproducibility |

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Data Processing

- Historical lottery data is automatically downloaded and processed
- Advanced feature engineering extracts patterns and statistical properties
- Time series sequences are created for deep learning models
- Data is normalized and split into training/validation/test sets

### 2. Model Training

The system trains multiple models:

- **LSTM Neural Network**: Learns temporal patterns in the sequence of draws
- **CNN-LSTM**: Hybrid model combining convolutional and recurrent layers for feature extraction
- **Ensemble Model**: Combines predictions from both models with optimized weights based on validation performance

### 3. Validation & Monitoring

- Time series validation with proper train/validation splits
- Custom lottery-specific metrics (exact matches, partial matches)
- Performance monitoring with detailed metrics tracking
- Model interpretation with feature importance analysis

### 4. Prediction Generation

- Ensembles multiple model predictions with optimized weights
- Uses perturbation techniques to generate diverse predictions
- Visualizes predictions for better understanding
- Saves predictions in both JSON and human-readable formats

## 🔮 Results

When you run the system, it will:

1. **Load or Train Models**: Either load pre-trained models or train new ones
2. **Validate Models**: Evaluate performance on validation data
3. **Generate Predictions**: Create diverse sets of lottery number predictions
4. **Visualize Results**: Create visual representations of the predictions
5. **Save Outputs**: Store all results in the outputs directory

The predictions are:
- Displayed in the terminal with detailed output
- Saved as JSON at `outputs/predictions/predictions_YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- Saved as readable text at `outputs/predictions/formatted_predictions_YYYY-MM-DD.txt`
- Visualized and saved at `outputs/visualizations/prediction_viz_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.png`

## 📊 Output Directory Structure

The system maintains an organized output structure:

- **predictions/**: Contains JSON and text format predictions
- **training/**: Stores model checkpoints (.h5 files) and training metadata
- **validation/**: Holds validation metrics and comparison visualizations
- **monitoring/**: Contains performance tracking over time
- **interpretations/**: Stores feature importance data
- **visualizations/**: Contains prediction visualizations and plots
